# Canways Game Of Life

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.<br />

## About project:
The goal was to create my own implementation of Conway's game of life in Java with JavaFX as a GUI to practice MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern in a desktop application and learn writing tests(TDD).<br />
The game starts with a blank board filled with little white squares. It allows the user to setup the initial state by clicking on squares and turning them black, thereby activating them. The game have a pause option, and an option to change its speed.<br/>
The project was created during my education in Codecool.

## Used technology:
* Java
* JavaFx
